Waterfall Model

--

Inflexibility to Change
Delayed Feedback
Limited Customer Involvement
Time consuming
High Risk
Not good for complex projetcs
Diffuclt to estimate

---

Agile

Mindset and Principles

- Iterative and Incremental development -> CI / CD

Continuous Integration

- Developer
- integrating new code
- central repository - ( source code repository - github)
- build my code
- run my tests ( automation - unit testing ) - passed
- code analysis / code scannig - vulenarbilites, best practices
- deploy

## Benefits:

Early bug detection
Reduced integration problems
Improved Code Quality
Faste Feedback
Faster time to market
Reduced Risk

Jenkins

## Workflow:

1. Coding - IDE VS Code
2. Write my unit tests
3. Save my code - Github Repository
4. Build my code ( build run time )
5. Deploy my code
